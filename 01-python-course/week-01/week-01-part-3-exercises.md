# Week 1 Exercises

## Practice exercises

Work through the following exercises of the book [Learn Python the hard
way](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA51198886720002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,Learn%20Python%20the%20Hard%20Way&offset=0)
by Zed Shaw (book is best read online):

- [ ] Exercise 3

- [ ] Exercise 5
- [ ] Exercise 6
- [ ] Exercise 29
- [ ] Exercise 30

**Tips:**

- **You should run these exercises non-interactively (i.e. as a Python program)!** To run a Python
  program, open the environment using the terminal, navigate to the folder where your `FILENAME.py`
  file is located (which you have created and edited using a text editor like Visual Studio Code)
  and execute it using the command `python FILENAME.py` (replacing 'FILENAME' with the actual name
  of the file).
- Note that in all of these exercises, the author gives you the code to run. Rather than copy
  pasting this code onto your text editor, the author and I strongly encourage you to type the
  program yourself in order to get practice writing Python code.
- If you're new to Python (and perhaps coding in general), try to do as many exercises as you can
  (given your time availability). There's quite a few exercises on the list above but, like learning
  a new spoken language, significant practice is required to develop a strong foundation. Otherwise,
  if you already have prior experience with Python, then you may already be familiar with most of
  these concepts (if so please feel free to skip).
- Each exercise has a "Study drills" section which I also recommend going through if you've got
  time.

## Self-assessment challenge

Implement the "Number guessing game" program specified in [Chapter 8]() of *A Beginner Guide to
Python 3 Programming* by John Hunt, and do the exercise specified in Section 8.7:

> Add the following additional features to the game:
>
> 1. Provide a cheat mode, for example if the user enters −1 print out the number they need to guess
> and then loop again. This does not count as one of their goes.
> 2. If their guess is within 1 of the actual number tell the player this.
> 3. At the end of the game, before printing 'Game Over', modify your program so that it asks the
> user if they want to play again; if they say yes then restart the whole thing.
