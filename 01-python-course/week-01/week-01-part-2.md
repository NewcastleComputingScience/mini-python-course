# Week 1 - Getting started with Python

Welcome to part 2 of this session. Now that you have a working Python environment, you will begin to
explore key python concepts, namely:

- Numbers and arithmetic operators
- Variable declaration and syntax
- Input and output
- Strings
- Booleans and None
- Flow control: if-else statements, for loops

For each theme there is a suggested textbook resource for you to read through. A very important
directive is that you **should reproduce the python statements and programs shown in the book as you
go along**. This will help you get used to running Python code and gain familiarity with the
language and its syntax. Try not to just read through the text without writing any code. 

Note that, in this part, you should use **IPython** to reproduce the python code presented to you in
the book.  To run Python interactively, open the environment with IPython or launch the QtConsole
prompt on Anaconda's home tab.
